== tinychat backend ==

/fixtures/fakedata.json contains an example of the JSON data that will be sent to the clientside.
The data looks like this where the last-edited field may or may not be present.
{
    messages: [
        {
            id: 1, 
            author: "", 
            timestamp: 1421953648024, 
            content: "",
            last-edited: 1421953648024,
            type: "outbound"
        }, 
        ...
    ], 
    last_seen: 1421953648024
}
